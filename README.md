# Malware_Classification_System

## A classification model which takes in all of the provided network data and correctly classifies the connection as Benign or if it is a malware, classify it as SMS Malware, Scareware or Adware.


# Working of the Model 
## Importing the Files
## Data Preprocessing
* In this step we first check if there are any rows containing NULL values and then eliminate those rows
* We then remove the columns which do not consist of any unique and only consist of a same value in all rows.
* We also split the elements of TimeStamp, Source IP and Destination IP into different columns and convert them from 'object' to 'int'.
## Model Testing
* We Test different classification models with the /train.csv/ file by splitting the file using Train_Test_Split function
* We then note the accuracy score and the mean absolute error (MAE).
* Models like Decision Tree Classifier, XG Boost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier have been tested here.
## Best Model Selection
* The model having the highest score and lowest MAE is selected as the best model.
* From the above tested models 'XG Boost Classifier' had the best accuracy (Score : 0.9758383670068735) and lowest MAE (MAE : 0.04832326598625286)
* Hence we have selected this model for Malware Classification.
## Malware Classification
* Using the best model obtained above we now perform predictions on the /test.csv/ file and store the predictions made in /Submission.csv/.

# Running the Model
## To get this model running we need to :
* Run the /malware-classification.ipynb/ file in the repository.
* Make sure you ru this file in either Google Colab(recommended) or Jupyter Notebook as it is a Jupyter Source File.
* Make sure you have mentioned the correct paths to the datasets provided in the repository.
